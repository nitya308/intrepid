Our mobile app gamifies getting out of your comfort zone. It encourages people to take risks and do things that they wouldn't necessarily do otherwise. 

## Architecture
This uses React Native running on Expo.

We will be using packages such as [react-native-maps](https://github.com/react-native-maps/react-native-maps)

## Setup

Run npx expo start in order to start the app.

## Deployment

This will be deployed on Expo and possibly TestFlight.
