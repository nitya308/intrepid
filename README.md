[Team Photo](src/images/readme-team-photo.jpeg)

Our mobile app gamifies getting out of your comfort zone. It encourages people to take risks and do things that they wouldn't necessarily do otherwise. 

## Architecture
This uses React Native running on Expo.

We will be using packages such as [react-native-maps](https://github.com/react-native-maps/react-native-maps)

## Setup/Deployment

First, run ```git clone``` to clone the repository.

Then, run ```cd project-nerve/rn-app``` and ```npm install``` to set up packages.

Run ```npx expo start``` to start the app.

This will be deployed on Expo and possibly TestFlight.
